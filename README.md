## 📚 Malware Types Covered
- **Virus** – Attaches to legitimate files and requires user execution  
- **Worm** – Self-replicates and spreads automatically over networks  
- **Trojan** – Disguised as legitimate software to gain unauthorized access  
- **Ransomware** – Encrypts data and demands ransom for recovery

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Studied various malware types and their characteristics.
2. Used known malware hashes instead of live malware samples.
3. Searched malware hashes on VirusTotal.
4. Analyzed antivirus detection reports.
5. Observed malware behavior indicators.
6. Studied the malware lifecycle.
7. Identified malware spread techniques.
8. Listed malware prevention methods.
9. Summarized findings in a classification report.
